In the recent generations man has seemed to seek for more efficient way to withdraw, transact money so hence ATMs were introduced. So we created a simpler version of an ATM using ‘lists’ and ‘if’ loops due to the simplicity of python programming language. Python is a user friendly programming language which has vast libraries and modules. It allows you to use functions to make the coding easier. Python is also open source, can be used on many platforms and bugs can be fixed more easily, therefore seeing the benefits of python, we have come with a very simple version of an ATM using python programming language.
